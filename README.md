# Project Idea

## Main Idea/Question

__What are the patterns underlying UFO sightings in the US?__

## Dataset

Potential Dataset 1:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/NUFORC/ufo-sightings

Potential Dataset 2: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishidamarla/ufo-sightings-approx-100000

This is data from the National UFO Research Center (NUFORC) collected of 80000+ UFO sightings over the last century. The sightings are predominantly located in the United States. The data details variables including: datetime, city, state, country, shape of ufo, duration in seconds, duration in hours/min, comments, lat, longitude of UFO sightings.

## Approach & Directions

Currently have many ideas which we will filter as we make preliminary explorations into the data, but some major directions include

* Where do sightings occur in the U.S?
	* Create a heat map of the USA by State or otherwise
	* Overlay this with other factors of the area, demographics, religiousness, superstitiousness etc... 
	* Overlay with points of interest such as military bases
	* __Investigate if there are any climate trends in areas with dense UFO sightings__
* When do sightings occur? 
	* Seasonally? 
	* Day of the Week? E.g. Friday night when people may be intoxicated? 
* Distribution of UFO shapes, which shapes appear where and when? 
* Text analysis on the sighting descriptions 
	* How similar/different are they, main words? Word Cloud? TFIDF? 
	* Investigate descriptions of major UFO events and their corresponding datapoints



# Team 10 Final Project Anticipated Schedule (Subject to Change)
by Wed 10/26: 
* Come up with overarching question
* Dataset(s) 
* General Summary of proposal 

Wed 10/26–Wed 11/02: 
* Validate and clean data 
* Create master CSV file with the ≥ 3 transformed variables 
* Perform preliminary analyses on your own and communicate your thoughts in the Slack to ensure your idea for an analysis does not overlap with another group member's 

Wed 11/02–Wed 11/09:
* Perform actual analyses and figure generation (Each person create 1 basic & we all work together on the more advanced EDA figure)

Wed 11/09–Wed 11/16:
* Write the report

Mon 11/28–Friday 12/02:
* Revise & Edit each other's sections of the report
* Make the presentation

Sat 12/03–Sat 12/10
* Revise & Edit each other's sections of the presentation
* Practice the presentation together as a group

Sunday 12/11:
* report & peer review due
